Thanks a lot to him! Mostly his files worked for me, only a few others where required.

I exchanged the original Intel WiFi card to a used Apple Airport Express WiFi5 (AC) card A1466 (Apple part number: Apple part number : 661-7481).
A NGFF M.2 Adapter is needed to fit the card in the socket. I used these search terms: BCM94360CS2 BCM943224PCIEBT2 12 + 6-poliges WLAN-Kartenmodul NGFF M.2 B9CRH
